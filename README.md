The source code of a small Godot game i made

It does not contain any private Ezcha Network data, only the main game and that's it. Feel free to do anything to it, but i'd like it if nobody reuploaded this game anywhere under someone elses name that isn't me, and i'd like it even less if it was sold.

Play the original game for free on the Ezcha Network: https://ezcha.net/games/starmarbleroll
(As i mentioned before, if you'd like to credit me you can just use the ezcha page)

! Information:

-If you wish to add more levels, just add a scene in the scenes/levels folder that follows the naming convention. Important: level counting actually starts at 0, meaning that Level 1 is actually Level 0 and Level 10 is actually Level 9.
